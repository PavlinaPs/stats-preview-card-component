## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS utility classes
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid areas
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had a hard time to figure out how to style the picture. I still think it is not perfect, but close.

I learned there are properties mix-blend-mode and background-blend-mode.

The **mix-blend-mode** CSS property sets how an element's content should blend with the content of the element's parent and the element's background.

The **background-blend-mode** CSS property sets how an element's background images should blend with each other and with the element's background color.

This is my fifth Frontend Mentor challenge, I also learned that writing a README about what I've learned helps me remember it better.

### Continued development

I need to continue to code a lot to get more experience. I guess there are still many CSS properties I don't know about.

### Useful resources

- [mix-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) on MDN including effects of different mix-blend-mode values
- [background-blend-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-blend-mode) on MDN, also with examples.
